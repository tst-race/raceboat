Detailed tests of addchangelogentry.py
======================================

Several items are prepared for us.

A git checkout of a project:

    >>> gitsourcedir
    'TESTTEMP/tha.example-git'
    >>> import os
    >>> import sys
    >>> os.chdir(gitsourcedir)

Asking input on the prompt is not unittestable unless we use the prepared
testing hack in utils.py:

    >>> from zest.releaser import utils
    >>> utils.TESTMODE = True

The message argument is required.  In the tests the error is ugly, but
in practice it looks fine::

    >>> from zest.releaser import addchangelogentry
    >>> addchangelogentry.main()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...too few arguments
    RuntimeError: SYSTEM EXIT (code=2)

Run the addchangelogentry script with a message and signalling okay to
commit::

    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['', '', '', '', ''])
    >>> sys.argv[1:] = ['My message.']
    >>> addchangelogentry.main()
    Checking data dict
    Question: OK to commit this (Y/n)?
    Our reply: <ENTER>

The changelog and setup.py are at 0.1 and have the message::

    >>> with open('CHANGES.txt') as f:
    ...     contents = f.read()
    >>> print(contents)
    Changelog of tha.example
    ========================
    <BLANKLINE>
    0.1 (unreleased)
    ----------------
    <BLANKLINE>
    - My message.
    <BLANKLINE>
    - Initial library skeleton created by thaskel.  [your name]
    <BLANKLINE>

Add some white space in front of the list items, to show that this is
kept when adding a message.  Make the list items stars instead of
dashes.  Commit the change so we have a clean checkout.

    >>> utils.write_text_file('CHANGES.txt', contents.replace('- ', '  * '))
    >>> commit_all_changes()

Add multiple lines in one go.

    >>> sys.argv[1:] = ['My longer message.\nOn two lines.']
    >>> addchangelogentry.main()
    Checking data dict
    Question: OK to commit this (Y/n)?
    Our reply: <ENTER>
    >>> with open('CHANGES.txt') as f:
    ...     print(f.read())
    Changelog of tha.example
    ========================
    <BLANKLINE>
    0.1 (unreleased)
    ----------------
    <BLANKLINE>
      * My longer message.
        On two lines.
    <BLANKLINE>
      * My message.
    <BLANKLINE>
      * Initial library skeleton created by thaskel.  [your name]
    <BLANKLINE>

Try non ascii for loads of fun:::

    >>> sys.argv[1:] = ['F\xc3\xbcr Elise']
    >>> addchangelogentry.main()
    Checking data dict
    Question: OK to commit this (Y/n)?
    Our reply: <ENTER>
    >>> with open('CHANGES.txt') as f:
    ...     contents = f.read()
    >>> print(contents)
    Changelog of tha.example
    ========================
    <BLANKLINE>
    0.1 (unreleased)
    ----------------
    <BLANKLINE>
      * F...r Elise
    <BLANKLINE>
      * My longer message.
         On two lines.
    <BLANKLINE>
      * My message.
    <BLANKLINE>
      * Initial library skeleton created by thaskel.  [your name]
    <BLANKLINE>

Corner case: a percent sign also works

    >>> sys.argv[1:] = ['100% perfect.']
    >>> addchangelogentry.main()
    Checking data dict
    Question: OK to commit this (Y/n)?
    Our reply: <ENTER>
    >>> with open('CHANGES.txt') as f:
    ...     contents = f.read()
    >>> print(contents)
    Changelog of tha.example
    ========================
    <BLANKLINE>
    0.1 (unreleased)
    ----------------
    <BLANKLINE>
      * 100% perfect.
    <BLANKLINE>
      * F...r Elise
    <BLANKLINE>
      * My longer message.
         On two lines.
    <BLANKLINE>
      * My message.
    <BLANKLINE>
      * Initial library skeleton created by thaskel.  [your name]
