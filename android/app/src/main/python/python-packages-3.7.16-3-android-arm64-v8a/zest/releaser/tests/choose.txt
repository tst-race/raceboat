Detailed tests of choose.py
===========================

Some initial imports:

    >>> from zest.releaser import choose
    >>> import os
    >>> from zest.releaser import utils
    >>> utils.TESTMODE = True

Choose makes the choice between version control systems.

Git:

    >>> os.chdir(gitsourcedir)
    >>> choose.version_control()
    <Git at TESTTEMP/tha.example-git .>

It works when we are in a sub directory too:

    >>> os.chdir(gitsourcedir)
    >>> os.chdir('src')
    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['n'])
    >>> choose.version_control()
    Question: You are NOT in the root of the repository. Do you want to go there? (y/N)?
    Our reply: n
    <Git at TESTTEMP/tha.example-git src>
    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['y'])
    >>> choose.version_control()
    Question: You are NOT in the root of the repository. Do you want to go there? (y/N)?
    Our reply: y
    <Git at TESTTEMP/tha.example-git .>

When no version control system is found, zest.releaser exits (with a log
message, but we don't test those yet):

    >>> os.chdir(tempdir)
    >>> choose.version_control()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: SYSTEM EXIT (code=1)
