# This file assists operators in (re-)deploying an obfs4 bridge Docker
# container.  You need the tool 'docker-compose' to use this file.  You
# can find it in the Debian package 'docker-compose'.
#
# First, you need to create a configuration file, ".env", in the same directory
# as this file, "docker-compose.yml".  Add the following environment variables
# to this configuration file.  EMAIL is your email address; OR_PORT is your
# onion routing port; and PT_PORT is your obfs4 port:
#
#   EMAIL=you@example.com
#   OR_PORT=XXX
#   PT_PORT=XXX
#
# If needed, you can also activate there an additional variables processing with:
#
#   OBFS4_ENABLE_ADDITIONAL_VARIABLES=1
#
# followed by defining desired torrc entries prefixed with OBFS4V_
# For example:
#
#   OBFS4V_AddressDisableIPv6=1
#
# Next, pull the Docker image, by running:
#
#   docker-compose pull obfs4-bridge
#
# And finally, to (re-)deploy the container, run:
#
#   docker-compose up -d obfs4-bridge
