https://spec.torproject.org/ext-orport-spec

To download a copy of the library into $GOPATH:
	go get gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/anti-censorship/pluggable-transports/goptlib

See the included example programs for examples of how to use the
library. To build them, enter their directory and run "go build".
	examples/dummy-client/dummy-client.go
	examples/dummy-server/dummy-server.go
The recommended way to start writing a new transport plugin is to copy
dummy-client or dummy-server and make changes to it.
