# This is the example configuration file for ptadapter's console script.
#
# Lines beginning with "#" are comments.
#
# Use absolute paths whenever possible.
# If a relative path is used in any path config, it will be converted to an
# abosolute path relative to the working directory when ptadapter starts.
#
# Section names are case-insensitive. Do not use the section name "default" or
# any case variation thereof.
#
# It is possible to have separate client and server configuration in the same
# config file.
#
# This file is for demonstration purposes. If two instances of ptadapter
# is run using this config file, one as server and one as client, three
# separate PT tunnels will be established, between client ends
# 127.0.0.1:8000, 127.0.0.1:8001 and 127.0.0.1:8002, and the server end
# 127.0.0.1:7000.
#
# Do not use this file on your actual server! When running an obfs4proxy
# server, you do not need to specify server keys in the config file. obfs4proxy
# will generate keys and store them in the state directory.

# ====================

# Client configuration
#
# A client configuration file must have a [client] section.
